This module is a part of the Usiku Games Blockchain #GamingForGood platform. 

The routine monitors a designated MetaMask Crypto wallet(s), which can be Etherium, Bitcoin, BNB, USDT, USDC, or Harmony $ONE. Upon seeing a change in balance in any of the wallets, the code fetches the current exchange rate and mints the approproate number of new in-game stable coins. These coins are managed off-chain (given the high volume of transactions) and so the balance is reflected in the master bank treasury stored in the game server database.

We believe this component can be of value to many crypto-hybrid social impact platforms in the future, allowing the projects to take in funding (from grants, investors or participants) save those in a safe treasury, and automatically mint a matching amount of off-chain stable coins for using within the project.
